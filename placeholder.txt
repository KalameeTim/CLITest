If you are new to contributing to open-source projects, we want to encourage you to take a look at this great guide made by GitHub on how to contribute to open-source projects [https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

feel free to reach out to any of the maintainers or other community members if you are struggling; we are here to help you learn!

## Contribute to Open Source Health!

### Here’s how to help out

- If you have any questions, first check and search the current issues to make sure there are no duplicates.
- Make sure all tests are successful when submitting a pull request.

### Join our discussions

Every Thursday we have an open invitation for you to join us as we talk about the project and metrics. This is to make sure that everyone can make their voice heard, even if you can’t contribute code. 

It’s also very important that this is a transparent process because we want this to be the best it can possibly be, and that can’t happen without the open input from you.

### Feature Request

You're also welcome to submit ideas for enhancements to open-source-health. When doing so, please search the issue list to see if the enhancement has already been filed. If it has, vote for 
it (add a reaction to it) and optionally add a comment with your perspective on the idea.

See our guide to writing feature requests for more on how to write a great feature request.

If you have any features you would like to suggest or you just want to discuss certain features of the project, the **Forum** is the way to go! Simply tag your post with the corresponding tag and everyone can see it there. This can then be discussed on the Thursday meetings.

## Ready? Let’s go!

To get started, fork this project to your own git.

`$ git clone github.com:your-username/osh.git
$ cd debricked/
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/<your username>/osh.git`

 Make sure to keep your fork up to date as well. You can do so by: 

INSTRUCTIONS

## Doing your work

When you start implementing your changes make sure that you create a new branch before. It’s the proper way to do things and also helps keep everything neatly organised from the master branch. This way it’s less headache inducing managing multiple PRs for every task completed.

Create Branch:

`$ git checkout -b my-new-branch`

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Tidy it up

Before submitting your PRs, we would appreciate it if you took some time to clean up your branch. This makes it a lot easier to test, accept and merge your changes into the master branch.

1. Commit the change(s) and push to your fork

`$ git add .
$ git commit -s -m "This is my first commit"
$ git push -u origin my-new-branch`

1. Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/compare).

# Bug Reports

**Before Submitting a Bug Report**

Make sure to include as much details as possible by using our general guidelines below before submitting a bug issue. 

- Make sure that your fork is up to date.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side.
- Make sure not to create duplicate issues, search the current issues before creating a new one.
- Collect information about the bug:
    - Possibly your input and the output
    - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

> Never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <security.osh@debricked.com>
